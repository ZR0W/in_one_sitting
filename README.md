1.5hr session
initial goal: create moving particles in a container animation
main roadblock: familiarity with matplotlib FuncAnimation capabilities and python IDE of choice not have animation display capabilities, nor full logging
presentable endproduct: a rotating rectangle
future goals: using new found familiarity with animating using matplotlib for future projects

quick idea: set template week into google calendar from python command; I essentially go thorugh the same process every week; the accuracy of the template isn't the point, it's a template for me to bounce ideas off of; Can prod do in 1 (maybe 2) sittings.

Imagine in some sci fi movie where the characters walk around with a tablet, and with a wave of their hands bring up either tablet content on the big screen to manipulate. Can try to achieve this with Socket Programming. Two devices, PC and android device on the saem local wifi network, can communicate and a android app could send information on a web page for some program to run (most likely a browswer launching a URL)

1 hr session
initial goal: ping a listening port on my PC from my phone
main roadblock: underestimated the technology and knoledge needed for this simple task. Network and potential security concerns that I was unfamiliar with.
presentable endproduct: a pair of server and client python processes that can send/receive simple information to eachother
future goals: implement proper interactability on server and client sides
As documented on Nov 6, the topic of socket programming came to my attention. In this session, I followed along a simply python server/client connection tutorial to familiarize myself with some basic topics.
